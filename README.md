# volume_controller
This is a Python project that adjusts system volume using hand gestures. It uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect finger movements via a webcam, allowing users to increase or decrease volume by changing the distance between their fingers. This hands-free control enhances convenience and accessibility.
